\section{Problem 1 - Monte Carlo}
\begin{center}{\it Code for this problem can be found mainly in \verb|ps2/largon/mac/doug_ana.py|, \verb|jackknife.py|, and the monte-carlo implementation in \verb|ps2/largon/src/LArgon.cxx|}\end{center}\\\hspace{1pt}\\
\indent A monte carlo algorithm is implemented in the previous liquid argon code with a few minor adjustments. I created a new method \verb|void LArgon::monte()| which contains the metropolis procedure. The liquid argon code can be switched back and forth between the microcanonical ensemble (constant particle number $N$, volume $V$, and energy $E$) evolved via lennard jones force and the canonical ensemble (constant $N$, $V$, and temperature $T$) evolved via monte carlo. To switch between the two, please edit the line in \verb|develop.cxx| from \verb|b.evolve()| to \verb|b.monte()|. The program output stream will be identical. In the metropolis scheme every ``step'' each particle's position is randomly displaced in a uniform box of side length $\pm 0.1\sigma$ using the function \verb|double LArgon::_get_ran_double(double min, double max)| which returns a random number on the interval min to max. As mentioned in the second problem set the \verb|boost::mt19937| generator is used. The particle's previous state is stored in $i-1$. The particles are selected in order, given a proposed new position, then the total change in potential energy is is computed. If the total change in potential energy is less, the step is accepted. If the energy is higher, the boltzman weight is computed,
\eq{
  p = e^{-\Delta E/T},
}
for $T$ the fixed energy of the heat bath (a program input parameter). A double precision number $z$ is chosen between 0 and 1. If $z < p$ the move is accepted, if not the particle is placed back in it's initial state. We ran the simulation for $N=864$ particles at a fixed temperature $T=1.069$ with density $\rho=0.75$ for 1000 steps. Only a fraction of the steps are displayed in each graph. The dimensionless energy and pressure are shown in Fig. \ref{energypressure}.

\end{figure}
The monte carlo thermalizes roughly on the same order of step size as the velocity-verlet integrator as found in the second problem set. We employ the jackknife to estimate errors on mean value of dimensionless potential energy and pressure (compressability according to the Verlet paper), the results are found in Fig. \ref{jacks}.

\end{figure}
We quote a statistical figure and error from the data on the potential energy per particle and the pressure and compare to the Verlet paper. The error on our mean values will be the jackknife standard deviation from a bin size of 300. $U/N$ is the potential energy per particle, and $P$ is the pressure, the results are an average over the final 8000 thermalized data points.

      Verlet Paper & -5.19 & 0.90 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
The monte carlo values are fairly close to Verlet's paper The are also consistent with the previous analysis in problem set 2.\\
\indent In the molecular dynamics simulations, the autocorrelation times for observables are related to physics quantities, therefore we study the autocorrelation times for the the potential energy and the virial. Using the standard formula from problem set 3 Fig. \ref{corrs} shows the autocorrelation function for the potential energy and the virial.

\section{Problem 2 - Wolff Ising with Metropolis}
\begin{center} {\it Code for this section can be found in \verb|ps4/ising/*| } \end{center}
I modified \verb|custer.C| to include presence on non-zero magnetic field. Each step, a cluster is identified by Wolff recursion and stored in \verb|int cluster[N*N]|. The total cluster magnetization $M_c$ is computed. If $B\cdot M_c <= 0$ the cluster is flipped 100\% of the time as is it energetically favorable. If positive, the boltzman weight is computed and a random number chosen. If the random number is less than the boltzman weight the spin is flipped in the direction of the field. The weaker the magnetic field the more likely spins of opposite orientation are flipped. The spin state is outputted into a data file \verb|the_spins.dat| as well as the absolute magnetization as a function of step. The program has also been modified to access three input prameters: temperature, magnetic field, and number of steps. The number of spins is hard coded. I made a spin viewer which uses ROOT's TH2D class to display an animation. The output (at fixed metropolis step) is shown in Fig. \ref{animation}. Fig. \ref{fields} shows a a fixed temperature $T=2.2$, $N\times N = 50\times 50$ system of ising spins. As the magnetic field increases the total magnetization tends to freeze in the magnetization. Next we plot the magnetization as a function of temperature $T$ to observe the phase transition at the critical temperature. We use the same $50\times50$ lattice having extrapolated to $B=0$. The figure of merit is shown in Fig. \ref{merit}. When comparing the curve from the analytical solution,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{M}{N} = \left(1-\sinh^{-4}\left(\frac{2}{T}\right)\right)^{1/8},
\end{align*}
the data fits the solution beautifully below the critical temperature $T_c$.

\section{Problem 3 - Correlation in 2D Ising Model}
\begin{center}{\it Code for this section can be found in \verb|spin_correlator.py|} and in \verb|cluster.C|\end{center}
\subsection*{3.1}
For this section we set $B=0$ and calculate the pairwise two point correlation function,
\begin{align*}
  \langle \sigma(x)\sigma(y) \rangle \sim \exp\left(\frac{|x-y|}{a(T)}\right)
\end{align*}
For $|x-y|$ integer displacements along the $x$ and $y$ axis and $a(T)$ the time dependent correlation length parameters. They theoretical dependence of $a(T)$ on $T$ is \,
\begin{align*}
  a(T) = \frac{1}{|T-T_c|},
\end{align*}
i.e. is has a critcal exponent of -1. For this section we calculate $\sigma(x)\sigma(y)$ by computing the parameters in a cross fashion (see loop in script) which calculates the correlation parameters and averages it over the entire lattice, respecting periodic bounary conditions. The only issue I found was with normalization but it doesn't seem so important as it can be ignored by making it a fit parameters. A few spectrums of mean $\sigma(x)\sigma(y)$ are computed for $n=m$ up to 10 as the problem suggests and then fit using the MINUIT fitter. A single fit result is shown in Fig. \ref{example} at $T=2.2$ near the critical temperature phase transition. One can observe the exponential decay law as expected in the mean correlation function as a function of displacement $n$.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \captionsetup[subfigure]{labelformat=empty}
  \subfloat[][]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/example_fit_T_22.eps}}
  \caption{\label{example} Example fit to $B=0$, $T=2.2$ correlation function as a function of distance. The result is exponential as expected. The fir parameters are displayed about the fit window. An extra constant p2 helped the fitter converge by displaying the exponential decay upwards relative to the x axis.}
\end{figure}


We then do multiple trials and scan the correlation parameter $a(T)$ over a range of values {\it less than} the critical temperature, plot the 2 point correlator, fit the TGraph with MINUIT, and extract the correlation length. The results are shown in Fig. \ref{power_law}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \captionsetup[subfigure]{labelformat=empty}
  \subfloat[][]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/power_law.eps}}
  \caption{\label{power_law} Inverse function increase in the correlation parameter as a function of temperature slightly below the critical temperature in (more or less) agreement with the expected curve. }
\end{figure}


The expected inverse function is found. With this method we find great difficulty in finding $a(T) < 1/8$ as mentioned in the problem. The most salient point is $a\propto |T-T_C|^{-1}$ as predicted by mean field theory and the renormalization procedure.

\subsection*{3.2}
We implement an improved method to calculate the correlation length parameter outlined in section 3.2. We compare the values which enter the two point correlator measurement before and after a call to the flip() function (or during). We find the the error (or the fluctuations in the measurement) are greatly reduced. With this implementation we are able to barely able to measure value of $a(T)$ below 1/8.
