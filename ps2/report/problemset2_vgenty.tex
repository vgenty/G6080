\section{Problem 1 - Planets}
\subsection{Part 1}
The lowest order corrector-predictor method is implemented in Python with the NumPy library to evolve the N body equations of motion. Using the initial conditions specified in Part 1, we find that a step size ``\verb|p.dx|'' of roughly $\mathbf{10^{-4}}$ with $\mathbf{300}\text{\bf{,}}\mathbf{000}$ steps was sufficient to keep the energy from deviating either above or below it's initial energy by one percent.

The lines above and below represent 1\% bounds on the initial total energy.}
\end{figure}
The trajectory, kinetic, potential, and total energy are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig1}.

\subsection{Part 2}
With the initial conditions specified in Part 2 and a step size of 60,000, the predictor-corrector algorithm fails for short range interactions shown in Fig. \ref{fig2}.

\hfill
  \caption{\label{fig2} Plots for part 2. Top pane shows the three trajectories of the planets. The energy spectrum near the end of the simulation blows up as one of the planet is ejected out of a bound orbit.}
\end{figure}
One of the planets is ejected from an initially bound orbit via two interactions with the second planet, and a fatal interaction with the massive sun. The total energy of the system explodes in the final steps as the step size on the predictor corrector algorithm is too large.
\clearpage
\subsection{Part 3}
In order to see the two planet interactions in the previous part we increase the number of iterations to {\bf 120,000} and decrease the step size to $\mathbf{4.0\times10^{-5}}$. I increased the evolution time past 75,000 as stated in the problem (an increase of 25\%) in order to observe the planets interact twice in their orbits around the sun. Reducing the step size greatly constrained deviation of the total energy. The step size must be much smaller due to the large predicted velocity and force during the close interaction when the potential energy is strongly negative. The results are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig3}

\end{figure}
With an improved predictor-corrector algorithm, for example a trapezoid correction, would greatly enhance the integration convergence.
\clearpage
\subsection{Part 4}
The gravitational assist simulation is set up with the initial rocket conditions,
\begin{align*}
v_x &= -8.0 \\
v_y &= 1.225.
\end{align*}
This set of initial conditions ensures the rocket slingshots off Venus rather than the much more massive sun. Plots of the trajectories of the Earth (red), Venus (black), and the rocket (blue) show the rocket's liftoff from near Earth, it's pass around venus and the ``sling shot'' effect in Fig. \ref{fig4}.

\section{Problem 2 - Liquid Argon}
The Lennard Jones potential is simulated for a gas of $N_p$ particles, in this case Liquid Argon, over $N_s$ time steps. The simulation was written in C++ with the aid of CERN's ROOT and the open source Boost C++ libraries. A summary of the code is as follows,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Execute main program \verb|develop| which either creates a \verb|LArgon| object from scratch, or reads an existing one out of the \verb|output/out.root| file. The main program \verb|develop| takes two option flags \verb|-r| or \verb|-c| to accomplish this task. \verb|develop -h| lists the command sequence.
\item The \verb|develop| project sets up the simulation on a \verb|LArgon| object be defining a number of private variables such as number of particles, steps, stepwise position, velocity, force, temperature, kinetic, potential energy, and a ``virial'' calculation.
\item The initial particle position is set on a lattice, and it's initial velocity distribution is generated uniformly on an interval with the \verb|boost::random::mt19937| generator with seed set via \verb|std::time(0)|. The center of mass velocity is set to zero and then scaled to the initial temperature.
\item The system is evolved for specified {\bf number of steps}, {\bf initial density}, {\bf number of particles}, and {\bf initial temperature} via the Velocity-Verlet algorithm.
\item The final simulation completes and the object is stored in a ROOT file for inspection by \verb|mac/reader.py|.
\end{enumerate}
To prove that the simulation works as expected, I ran the program with the following initial conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N_P = 1000$ \# of particles. 
\item $N_s = 1000$ \# of steps.
\item $T_i = 2.0$ initial temperature.
\item $\rho = 1.0$ initial density.
\end{itemize}
The following initial position of the particles are shown in Fig.\ref{fig5}.

\end{figure}
Particles are spaced out based on requested density and number of particles. First, particles are placed maximally apart on the corners of a standard cubic lattice and then backfilled on the sites of a face-centered cubic until all the particles are placed in the box. If the number of particles is too high for the specified density and exceed particle separated larger than required on an fcc, the density and particle number are rejected by the program. Fig. \ref{fig6} shows the 1000 particles on the cubic lattice. Fig. \ref{fig7} shows the initial velocity distribution.

After the simulation is evolved, the velocity distribution evolves to the expected Maxwell distribution (gaussian) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig8} and Fig. \ref{fig9}.

The simulation obeys time reversal. At step 250 all of the particle velocities are flipped in sign and the system evolves back to the initial state. This feature is shows in the temperature spectrum in Fig. \ref{fig11}.

\end{figure}
Code is implemented to determine the instantaneous pressure of the system by keeping track of the so called ``virial'' of the system,
\begin{align*}
\text{virial} = \sum_i\sum_{i\neq j}r_{ij}F_{ij},
\end{align*}
which can be mapped to the pressure using the standard formula. For temperature $T=1.069$ at a density of $\rho=0.75$ the average ``compressibility''' was $\beta P/\rho \approx 0.88$ in agreement with Verlet's paper.
