\section{Poisson's Equations}
I implemented the conjugate gradient method in \texttt{poissonONE.cpp} to solve poisson's equation for the given charge and boundary conditions. Using the finite difference approximation to discretize the 2-dimensional Poisson equation on a uniform grid,
\begin{align*}
(\nabla^2 V)_{ij} = \frac{1}{a^2}\left(V_{i+1,j} + V_{i-1,j} + V_{i,j+1} + V_{i,j-1} - 4V_{ij}\right)
\end{align*}
The linear system of $(N+1)^2$ equations is constructed in the form $Ax=b$ where $A$ is the laplace finite difference operator, $x$ is the unknown potential distribution, and $b$ is the specified charge distribution. Special care is needed to ensure dirichlet boundary conditions on the edges of the box {\it and} on a specified region of constant potential. I used the C++ library \texttt{eigen3} which is a template library for linear algebra: matricies, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms. After the completion of the program for the specified lattice spacing the potential is written to a \texttt{ROOT} file and plotted in \texttt{plotter.py}, a python script. For the first part I chose two different nearby locations and computed $V(x,y)$ for a few lattice spacing to see if the points appeared to converge to some value. I then fit a linear function to the data points to extrapolate to zero lattice spacing. The results are plotted in Fig. \ref{extrapolation}. For smaller lattice spacing $a$ the potential values appeared to get {\it closer} together signifying a convergence to a true ``continuous'' value. For small changes in lattice spacing, the potential did not vary much. The extrapolation to zero $a$ (the y-intercept) is shown for each of the two plots.  The two calculations of potential are near each other in the physical space and should therefore have nearly equivalent y-intercepts with the small deviation being attributed to the change in potential. This is clearly the case. We now plot the potential distribution as a surface plot in \texttt{ROOT}. The salient features of Fig. \ref{poissons} are zero boundary conditions at the edges, a negative point charged situated south of the constant positive potential plateau, and a region of fixed positive potential. In the continuous case the negative charge is considered as a dirac delta function at the point in question, this is not possible for discrete case. To avoid this I smeared out the charge onto the four nearby lattice points creating an effective surface charge rather than a point charge. For smaller and smaller lattice spacing the surface charge will mimick a point of infinite potential. The physical shape of the result is shown in Fig. \ref{poissons} and is as expected for a solution to the boundary value problem.

\section{Free particle Schrodinger equation}
We now consider the quantum mechanics of an {\it uncharged} particle bounded in the same square region with the point charge removed. Here we let the mass of the particle be $m=1/10$ in dimensionless units ($\hbar = 1$). The boundary and internal rectangle are infinite potential (where the particle wavefuntion must vanish). I implemented the invserse iteration scheme (more or less in the file \texttt{schrodingerPLAY.cpp}) to find the three lowest eigenvalues of the energy satisfying the equation,
\begin{align*}
  -\frac{1}{2m} \nabla^2\psi + V(x,y)\psi = E\psi.
\end{align*}
The results for the three lowest probability distributions for the particle in the box with lattice spacing $a\sim0.01$ are shown in Fig. \ref{particles}. The three lowest eigen-energies to three significant figures are in the table below.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c | c | c }
    \hspace{1pt} & Ground & 1$^{\text{st}}$ excited & 2$^{\text{nd}}$ excited \\ \hline
    Energy & 151 & 270 & 368
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
The particle in the box resembles the unperturbed harmonic solution to the 2 dimensional square well with the particle avoiding the rectagular region, because of this the energy does not scale as $n^2$ (the square of the number of anti-nodes). The probability distribution does show the expected increase in number of nodes the higher the energy where is it is more probable on average to be found in a larger region of the box (spreading out classically).

\section{Charged particle Schrodinger equation}
I implemented the Lanczos algorithm in C++ to generate the tridiagonal Lanczos matrix.  Unfortunately \texttt{eigen3} (I think) does not support sparse matrix decomposition which you could imagine poses a difficulty in terms of execution time. To find the lowest eigenvalues we use the so called ``Cholesky'' decomposition for selfadjoint matrices. Using the same potential function as as in problem 2 I find the eigen energy associated with charged particle potential in the ground state to be $\boxed{E\approx-441}$ in dimensionless units. An important feature here is that the eigenvalue is negative indicating an attractive potential (just as in the case of the hydrogen atom/delta function). The result is shown in Fig. \ref{lanczos}. The particle's probability density clusters around the location of maximum potential as expected from quantum mechanics. In addition the particle tends to slightly avoid the square rectagle although it may be difficult to discern from the plot itself.

\end{figure}
  We choose the dimensionless point charge to be $q=50$. The probability for the ground state to be in the southern region appears to be {\bf much} larger than 50\%. Unfortunately I was unable to tune to charge enough to get the wavefunction to actually spread out over the region of the box.
