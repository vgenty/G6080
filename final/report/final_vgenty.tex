\section*{1.1 Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Te updating scheme in Eq. (2) is unitary because it preserves the integral squared norm of the state vector in time i.e.
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{\mathbb{R}} dx \left|\phi(t+\Delta t)\right|^2 = \int_{\mathbb{R}} dx \left|\phi(t)\right|^2.
  \end{align*}
  Therefore it's sufficient to check if the updating scheme is norm preserving at $n+1$ and $n$. So,
  \begin{align*}
    \left|\phi^{(n+1)}\right|^2 &= \left|\frac{1-i H \Delta t/2}{1+i H \Delta t/2}\right|\left|\phi^{n}\right|^2 \\
    &= \frac{1-i H \Delta t/2}{1+i H \Delta t/2}\cdot\frac{1+i H^{\dagger} \Delta t/2}{1-i H^{\dagger} \Delta t/2}.
  \end{align*}
  Now the Hamiltonian is hermitian, $H = H^{\dagger}$ so,
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{1-i H \Delta t/2}{1+i H \Delta t/2}\cdot\frac{1+i H \Delta t/2}{1-i H \Delta t/2} &=  1,\\
  \end{align*}
  as the numerator and denominator cancel leaving,
  \begin{align*}
    \left|\phi^{n+1}\right|^2 = \left|\phi^n\right|^2.
  \end{align*}
  Therefore the updaing scheme is unitary.
\item The Schrodinger equation and be nondimensionalized with the substitutions,
  \begin{align*}
    \widetilde{\phi}&=\phi\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m c}}\\
    \widetilde{x}&=x\left(\frac{mc}{\hbar\right)}\\
    \widetilde{t}&=t\left(\frac{mc^2}{\hbar}\right)\\
    \widetilde{V}&=V\left(\frac{1}{mc^2}\right),
  \end{align*}
  leaving the Schrodinger equation as,
  \begin{align*}
    -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\widetilde{x}^2}\widetilde{\phi}+\widetilde{V}\widetilde{\phi} = i \frac{\partial}{\partial\widetilde{t}}\widetilde{\psi}.
  \end{align*}
  This gives the updating scheme the following form,
  \eq{
    \chi_{j+1}^{(n)}+\left(-2+\frac{4i\widetilde{\epsilon}^2}{\Delta\widetilde{t}}-2\widetilde{\epsilon}^2\widetilde{V_j}\right)\chi_j^{(n)} + \chi_{j-1}^{(n)} = \frac{8i\widetilde{\epsilon}^2}{\Delta\widetilde{t}}\phi_j^{(n)}.
  }
  The total range of the simulation is fixed to $-1 < x < 1$. We also set the mass $m$ equal to 1. {\bf come back to me}
\end{enumerate}
\section*{1.2 Evolution of a wavepacket}
We start with a normalized gaussian wave packet at $t=0$,
\eq{
\phi(x,t=0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma \sqrt{\pi}}}\exp\left(ikx\right)\exp\left(-(x-x_0)^2/\left(2\sigma^2\right)\right).
}
This particular wave packet has a fixed expecation energy value given by,
\begin{align*}
  \<E\> &= \<\phi|E|\phi\> = \<\phi|\frac{p^2}{2m}|\phi\> = \int_{\mathbb{R}}dx\<\phi|x\>-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\<x|\phi\> \\
  &= \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m \sigma^2},
\end{align*}
and with our choice of units is
\eq{
\<E\> = \frac{k^2}{2} +  \frac{1}{4\sigma^2}.
}
Rearranging we can choose the input momentum based on the given energy,
\eq{
k = \sqrt{2 E - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}}
  }
I checked my implementation of the algorithm, specifically my implementation of the LU factorization of the tridiagonal matrix. I evolved the free particle for a total time step of 1000, 500 steps in the forward direction then fliping the sign of the time step $dt$ and then evolving 499 steps in the reverse direction to check for unitarity. Snapshots of the wavepackets are shown in Fig. \ref{evolution}. The wavepackets are nearly identical before and after the evolution. As the gaussian propogates it spreads out in position as epected from a free particle. The elongated wave at $t=T/2$ then begins narrowing as the algorithm is reversed. We check the unitarity of the state as a function of time and plot in Fig. \ref{unitarity}. The unitarity of the state does not deviate from one out of IEEE double precision during the duration of the test simulation indicating fantastic conserved unitarity.

\subsection*{1.3 Scattering from a step function potential}
We scatter wavepackets of varying widths and incident energies at step potentials. For this problem we must ensure the wavepacket is sufficiently localized and therefore energetic enough to quickly scatter off the step potential without encountering effects from hitting the infinite walls. In Fig. \ref{EoverV} I plot the reflection and transmission coefficient for two fixed step potentials as a function of incoming energy at fixed width $\sigma=0.05$ (essentially the varying the average wavenumber $k$). A smooth rise of the transmission and lull of the of the reflection coefficient is observed for increasing energy. This result is different than for discrete incoming plane waves with fixed wavenumber. The quantum wave train softens the edge between at the classically allowed turning point which is expected as the wavepacket contains a distribution of wavenumbers based on it's width. Doubling the potential only had the effect of increasing the curvature of the reflection and transmission lines. Next I examine the two coefficients as a function of initial width in Fig. \ref{sigmas}. The wider the initial wavepacket the more defined the incoming value for the wavenumber since $k\propto 1/\sigma$. In Fig. \ref{sigmas} the reflection and tranmission coefficients approach their analytical plane wave values for $E>V$ stated withouth proof,
\begin{align*}
T &= \frac{4 k_1 k_2 }{(k_1 + k_2)^2}\\
R &= \frac{(k_1 - k_2)^2}{(k_1+k_2)^2},
\end{align*}
with,
\begin{align*}
k_1 &= \sqrt{2E}\\
k_2 &= \sqrt{2(E-V)},
\end{align*}
in our dimensionless units $\hbar=c=1$ and $m=1$ for incoming plane waves with definite momentum. I chose fixed energy $E=1.25\cdotV$ and observed that increasing the width of the wavepacket forced the coeffiecients to their plane wave values of,
\begin{align*}
T&=0.854\\
R&=0.146.
\end{align*}
Varying the size of the step potential did not appear to have any effect.

\subsection*{1.4 Decay of an unstable state}
We set up the quantum well potential as shown in the diagram. We start with the wavefunction in an eigenstate of an infinite well with wavefunction,
\begin{align*}
\phi = \sqrt{\frac{2}{w}}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{w}x),
\end{align*}
with energy,
\begin{align*}
E = \frac{\pi^2}{2 w^2},
\end{align*}
in our dimensionless units ($m=1$). For this simulation we set $w=0.1$, $s=0.01$, $b=0.50$, $h=3000.0$, and center the basin around $x=0$. The initial wave function and the wavefunction during the decay is plotted in Fig. \ref{decaying}. The initial energy of the wave function $E\approx494$ using the equation above. We then plot the probability for the particle to be found in the well as a function of time and fit the data points before the leaked probability reflects from the wall. The results are shown in Fig. \ref{expoo}. The particle diffused outside the well with time constant on the order of 100.

\subsection*{1.5 Scattering}
We now consider scattering from this potential in the previous problem. I sent in wave packet to scatter the potential in the previous problem. The result is plotten in Fig. \ref{resonance}. Peaks in the spectrum occur on intervals spaced quadratically mirroring the energy splitting between the levels ifinite well potential. Even more interesting is that these energies correspond the energies of the infinite well of width $w$ !!!
